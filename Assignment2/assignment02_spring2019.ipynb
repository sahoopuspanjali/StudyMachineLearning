    "  + The Python standard library is not enough to do solve these questions. You will need to import appropriate libraries for each task. Generally, you might import and use any library you wish unless otherwise stated. \n",
    "  + Where detail instructions like variable or function names, required libraries, and etc are not given by the question, feel free to do it the way you would like to.\n",
    "  + After each question, add the needed number of new cells and place your answers inside the cells. \n",
    "  + When you are required to explain or answer in text format open a Markdown cell and enter your answer in it.\n",
    "  + Do not remove or modify the original cells provided by the instructor.\n",
    "  + Comment your code whenever needed using # sign at the beginning of the row.\n",
    "  + Do not hesitate to communicate your questions to the TAs or instructors. Good luck! "
